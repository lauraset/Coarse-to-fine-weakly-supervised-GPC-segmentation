## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
python >=3.6
pytorch >= 1.7.0 (lower version may be also work)
GPU: NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti GPU (11G memory)
```
## Prepare datasets
Google earth images download steps:
1. Add a XYZ tile in the browser panel. 
For google earth images, a available link for XYZ connection is https://mt1.google.com/vt/lyrs=s&x={x}&y={y}&z={z}.
2. Load the created link to QGIS, and open the python in QGIS. 
3. Run the following code
```
python qgis_download_google.py
```

## Model development


This part will be available after the manuscript is accepted.
