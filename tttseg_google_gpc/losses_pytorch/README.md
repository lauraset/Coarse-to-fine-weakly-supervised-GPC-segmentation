PyTorch Implementation of commonly used loss functions for medical image segmentation tasks.

Some codes are from
- [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet)
- [Loss_ToolBox-PyTorch](https://github.com/Hsuxu/Loss_ToolBox-PyTorch)
- [3D U-Net](https://github.com/wolny/pytorch-3dunet/blob/master/unet3d/losses.py)

All the loss functions have been tested with [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet). Also, they can be used in a plug-and-play way.
